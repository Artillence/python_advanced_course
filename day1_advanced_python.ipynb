    "- `re.match(pattern, text)` - match only at the **beginning** of the string.\n",

    "- `re.finditer(pattern, text)` - return an **iterator** of match objects.\n",
    "- `re.sub(pattern, repl, text)` - replace all matches with `repl`.\n",

    "- Anchors:  \n",
    "  - `^` start of string, `$` end of string\n",
    "- Groups:  \n",
    "  - `( ... )` capturing group, `(?: ... )` non-capturing group\n",

    "### ⚡ Exercise (Advanced): Fractional Range Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Build an advanced iterator class that generates fractional numbers within a given range. This exercise will help you practice creating custom iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise Description:\n",
    "You are to create a custom iterator class `FractionalRange` that behaves similarly to Python's built-in `range()` [function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range) but supports fractional values. This class should accept three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. It should generate numbers starting from `start` up to but not including `stop`, with increments of `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "   - `start`: The starting value of the sequence.\n",
    "   - `stop`: The end value of the sequence (not inclusive).\n",
    "   - `step`: The increment value for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration Methods**:\n",
    "   - `__iter__`: Should return the iterator object itself.\n",
    "   - `__next__`: Should return the next value in the sequence and raise `StopIteration` when the end of the range is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases**:\n",
    "   - Handle cases where `step` is zero (which should raise a `ValueError`).\n",
    "   - Ensure that if `start` is equal to `stop`, the iterator doesn't generate any values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "- Implement the `FractionalRange` class based on the above specifications.\n",
    "- Test the code using the presented test-cases to verify that the iterator works correctly with integer and fractional steps.\n",
    "- Make sure to handle potential edge cases and errors."
