    "## Topic 4 - AsyncIO for concurrent I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module lets you write **concurrent** programs using the `async` / `await` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `threading` or `multiprocessing`, AsyncIO usually runs **in a single OS thread**. It uses an **event loop** that rapidly switches between many \"tasks\" (coroutines) whenever they are waiting for I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coroutine**: a function defined with `async def`. Calling it does **not** run it, it returns a coroutine object (a bit like creating a `Task` in LabVIEW or a job in a scheduler).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  async def measure():\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "  c = measure()  # coroutine object, not a result yet\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Event loop**: a scheduler that runs coroutines. In scripts you usually start it with `asyncio.run(main())`. In Jupyter, the notebook already runs an event loop for you, so you can use `await` directly at the top level.\n",
    "- **`await`**: suspends the current coroutine until the awaited operation is finished, and lets the event loop run other tasks in the meantime.\n",
    "  - You can only use `await` **inside** `async def` functions (or at the top level in special environments like Jupyter).\n",
    "  - This is like saying \"I am waiting for the ADC / network / disk - while I wait, please do something else\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does AsyncIO help?\n",
    "\n",
    "AsyncIO is ideal when your program is **I/O bound** and spends most of its time waiting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many concurrent HTTP requests (web scraping, microservices).\n",
    "- Talking to many instruments over TCP/serial/USB at once.\n",
    "- File or database operations that frequently wait on the OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does **not** make pure Python CPU loops faster. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) still limits CPU bound code. For heavy numeric work you usually use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy / vectorization** (day 3 topic),\n",
    "- **C / C++ extensions**, or\n",
    "- **multiprocessing** to use multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does control flow work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the event loop as a conductor for an orchestra of coroutines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You define `async def` coroutines.\n",
    "2. You create tasks from them (for example with `asyncio.create_task`).\n",
    "3. The event loop picks a task, runs it until it hits an `await` on something that is not yet ready (e.g. `await asyncio.sleep(0.5)` or an async network call).\n",
    "4. At that `await`, the coroutine \"pauses\", the loop switches to another ready task.\n",
    "5. When the awaited I/O operation completes, the loop resumes the paused coroutine right after the `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because tasks yield control at `await`, many of them can **make progress in overlapping time** - even though there is a single underlying OS thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequently asked questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why can I not `await` in a normal function?**  \n",
    "Because the Python grammar only allows `await` inside `async def` (or in special interactive environments). A normal `def` function does not know how to suspend and resume itself. If you want to use `await`, you must either:\n",
    "- make the function `async def`, or\n",
    "- call an async function from the **outside** using `asyncio.run(my_async_main())` in a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When is the event loop actually running?**  \n",
    "- In a **script**, when you call `asyncio.run(main())` (which internally creates and runs an event loop).\n",
    "- In **Jupyter**, there is already a loop running; the notebook integrates with it so `await` works at the top level. That is why you can simply do `await main()` in a notebook cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I actually get real benefits?**  \n",
    "1. Identify I/O operations that can run in parallel (waiting for TCP sockets, serial ports, HTTP, `asyncio.sleep`, etc.).\n",
    "2. Wrap them in `async def` coroutines that `await` the I/O.\n",
    "3. Start many tasks with `asyncio.create_task` or `asyncio.gather`.\n",
    "4. Let the event loop interleave their waiting periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we compare sequential vs async measurements to see the effect in practice.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python functions that operate mainly on NumPy arrays and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numba import njit\n",
    "\n",
    "@njit\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    # numerical code\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first call `f`, Numba compiles it to machine code (using LLVM). Subsequent calls run at near-C speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: how Numba and NumPy interact\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy operations like `a + b` or `a.mean()` are already implemented in C.\n",
    "- However, **Python loops around those operations** still run in the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- Numba helps most when you have **custom loops and logic** that cannot be expressed as simple NumPy expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering the question:** \"If Numba works with NumPy + Python code, and NumPy is already implemented in C, how does Numba JIT help?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is fast for each individual operation, but if you write Python like:\n",
    "  - `for i in range(n): result[i] = complex_expression(a[i], b[i])`\n",
    "  - this loop runs in Python and pays Python overhead per iteration.\n",
    "- Numba compiles the **whole loop** (and the operations inside it) into one optimized machine code function.\n",
    "- This removes Python overhead and can fuse several operations into one pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, combine them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use NumPy vectorization where it is natural.\n",
    "- Use Numba for custom numeric kernels that are hard to write as a single NumPy expression."
