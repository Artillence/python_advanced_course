    "\n",
    "[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python functions that operate mainly on NumPy arrays and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numba import njit\n",
    "\n",
    "@njit\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    # numerical code\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first call `f`, Numba compiles it to machine code (using LLVM). Subsequent calls run at near-C speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: how Numba and NumPy interact\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy operations like `a + b` or `a.mean()` are already implemented in C.\n",
    "- However, **Python loops around those operations** still run in the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- Numba helps most when you have **custom loops and logic** that cannot be expressed as simple NumPy expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering the question:** \"If Numba works with NumPy + Python code, and NumPy is already implemented in C, how does Numba JIT help?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is fast for each individual operation, but if you write Python like:\n",
    "  - `for i in range(n): result[i] = complex_expression(a[i], b[i])`\n",
    "  - this loop runs in Python and pays Python overhead per iteration.\n",
    "- Numba compiles the **whole loop** (and the operations inside it) into one optimized machine code function.\n",
    "- This removes Python overhead and can fuse several operations into one pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, combine them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use NumPy vectorization where it is natural.\n",
    "- Use Numba for custom numeric kernels that are hard to write as a single NumPy expression."
